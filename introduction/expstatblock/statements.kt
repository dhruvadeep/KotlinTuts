//Statements are everything that make up a complete unit of execution. For example,
//
//val score = 90 + 25
//Here, 90 + 25 is an expression that returns 115, and val score = 9*5; is a statement.
//
//Expressions are part of statements.
//
//Some examples:
//
//println("Howdy")
//var a = 5
//++a
//max = if (a > b) a else b
